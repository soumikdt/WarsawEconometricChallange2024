# Warsaw Econometric Challenge: Vaccination as a Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic

## About the Warsaw Econometric Challenge
The **Warsaw Econometric Challenge** is a unique and exciting econometric experience organized by the **Faculty of Economic Sciences at the University of Warsaw**. This event challenges participants to analyze a given dataset and write a comprehensive scientific report within **24 hours**. It is a thrilling opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students to showcase their analytical skills, teamwork, and ability to work under pressure. The challenge not only tests econometric knowledge but also emphasizes collaboration, creativity, and time management.

Our team of four—**Vikram Bahadur, Soumik Dutta, Anindita Basu, and Sana Ahmed**—participated in the fourth edition of this event. We worked together to analyze data on COVID-19 vaccination rates in Poland and produced a report titled **"Vaccination as a Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic."**

## Project Overview
This project investigates the public response to COVID-19 vaccination in Poland, focusing on various drivers of societal behavior. Using open-access data from the **Polish Ministry of Health** and **Statistics Poland**, we analyzed the impact of factors such as urbanization, demographic profiles, political views, and geographical partitions on vaccination rates. Our findings reveal disparities in vaccine uptake between urban and rural areas, with younger age groups exhibiting lower acceptance rates. Additionally, urbanization and political trust in certain regions contributed to a positive attitude toward vaccination.

## Key Research Questions
1. Does the size of municipalities/cities impact vaccination rates?
2. Is there a division between eastern and western Poland based on historical partitions or the Vistula River?
3. Does age impact vaccination rates?
4. Is there a significant relationship between vaccination rates and political views?
5. Does neighborhood influence vaccination response?

## Methodology
We employed **linear regression, scatter plots, and box plots** to analyze the data. For the neighborhood impact analysis, we created adjacency lists of municipalities and calculated the standard deviation of vaccination percentages in each neighborhood. This helped us understand whether vaccination behavior spreads contagiously.

## Key Findings
1. **Urbanization**: Urban areas showed a moderately positive correlation between population size and vaccination rates, while rural areas exhibited a weaker association.
2. **Geographical Partition**: Western Poland had higher vaccination rates compared to the eastern regions.
3. **Demographics**: Municipalities with a higher fraction of 15-29-year-olds had lower vaccination rates, while those with a higher fraction of 30-44-year-olds had higher rates.
4. **Political Views**: Regions historically under Prussian influence showed higher vaccination rates, suggesting a link between political trust and vaccine acceptance.
5. **Neighborhood Impact**: Most municipalities had similar vaccination rates to their neighbors, indicating a contagion-like spread of vaccination behavior.
